- **Repositories:** Abstract data access, handle database operations
- **Middleware:** Implement cross-cutting concerns (auth, logging, validation)
- **Error Handling:** Centralized error handling with proper HTTP status codes
- **Validation:** Input validation using libraries like Joi or Yup

## Code Quality Guidelines

- **Readability:** Write self-explanatory code with meaningful names
- **Functions:** Keep functions focused and under 50 lines when possible
- **Magic Numbers:** Use named constants or environment variables
- **Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling with proper logging
- **Async Patterns:** Use async/await for I/O operations, avoid callback hell
- **Resource Management:** Ensure proper cleanup of database connections, file handles

## Security Best Practices

- **Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- **Authentication:** Implement secure authentication (JWT, OAuth, etc.)
- **Authorization:** Role-based access control for API endpoints
- **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **CORS:** Configure CORS properly for cross-origin requests
- **Environment Variables:** Never commit secrets, use environment variables
- **SQL Injection:** Use parameterized queries or ORM to prevent injection
- **Helmet.js:** Use security middleware for common vulnerabilities

## Performance Optimization

- **Database Queries:** Optimize queries, use indexes, avoid N+1 problems
- **Caching:** Implement caching strategies (Redis, in-memory cache)
- **Connection Pooling:** Use connection pooling for database connections
- **Compression:** Enable gzip compression for responses
- **Pagination:** Implement pagination for large datasets
- **Monitoring:** Add performance monitoring and logging

## Naming Conventions

- **Files:** Use kebab-case for file names (e.g., `user-controller.ts`, `auth-middleware.ts`)
- **Classes:** PascalCase (e.g., `UserService`, `DatabaseRepository`)
- **Functions/Methods:** camelCase (e.g., `getUserById`, `validateRequest`)
- **Variables:** camelCase (e.g., `userId`, `isValid`, `requestData`)
- **Constants:** SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS`, `JWT_SECRET`)
- **Interfaces:** PascalCase with 'I' prefix (e.g., `IUserRepository`, `IAuthService`)
- **Types:** PascalCase (e.g., `UserData`, `ApiResponse`, `ConfigOptions`)
- **Endpoints:** RESTful naming (e.g., `/api/v1/users`, `/api/v1/users/:id`)

# Project Structure Guidelines

## Root Directory Standards

- **Clean Root:** Only essential files in root (README.md, CHANGELOG.md, package.json, LICENSE)
- **Configuration Files:** Keep configuration files organized (eslint, prettier, jest, docker)
- **Environment Files:** Use .env files for configuration, never commit .env to git

# Development Guidelines

## Core Development Practices

- **TypeScript First:** Use TypeScript for all code files with strict type checking
- **API-First Design:** Design APIs before implementation, use OpenAPI specs
- **Security by Design:** Consider security implications in every design decision
- **Performance Awareness:** Consider performance implications, especially for high-traffic APIs
- **Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling with proper HTTP status codes
- **Logging:** Structured logging with appropriate levels (debug, info, warn, error)
- **Testing:** Write tests for all critical business logic and API endpoints

## Testing Strategy

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Write tests before implementing features
- **Coverage Goals:** Aim for high test coverage of critical business logic
- **Test Types:**
  - Unit tests for services and utilities
  - Integration tests for database operations
  - API tests for endpoints
  - Load tests for performance validation
- **Test Data:** Use realistic fixtures and factories for testing
- **Mocking:** Mock external services and dependencies in tests

## Documentation Standards

- **Documentation Architecture:** Maintain strict separation between system documentation (evergreen, no status indicators) and project management documentation (status tracking, temporal language)
- **Code Documentation:** Use JSDoc comments for public APIs and complex logic
- **API Documentation:** Maintain OpenAPI/Swagger specifications
- **README Updates:** Keep main README.md current with setup and deployment instructions using factual, present-tense language
- **Changelog:** Maintain detailed CHANGELOG.md with all notable changes
- **Architecture Decisions:** Record significant architectural decisions
- **Status Indicators:** Use status emojis only in project management docs, never in system documentation

## Development Workflow

## 7-Step Mandatory Development Process

**ALL development tasks must follow this strict workflow to ensure code quality, proper testing, and comprehensive documentation.**

### Step 1: Task Understanding and Planning

- **Always start with clarification:** Ask questions to fully understand the requirements
- **Provide implementation outline:** Present the shortest possible outline of the implementation plan with key details
- **Get explicit confirmation:** Wait for user confirmation before proceeding
- **Clarify scope:** Ensure both parties understand what will be implemented and what won't

### Step 2: Task Management

- **Update task list:** Add corresponding task(s) to `/_meta/project-task-list.md`
- **Set task status:** Mark tasks as "In Progress" with clear descriptions
- **Break down complex tasks:** Split large tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks
- **Estimate effort:** Provide realistic time/complexity estimates

### Step 3: Test-Driven Development (TDD)

- **Document test cases first:** Write test cases in `/test/test-documentation.md`
- **Define expected behavior:** Clearly specify inputs, outputs, and edge cases
- **Implement tests:** Create actual test files that verify the documented behavior
- **Verify test failure:** Run tests to confirm they fail appropriately (red phase)
- **Only then implement:** Write the minimum code needed to make tests pass (green phase)

### Step 4: Implementation and Verification

- **Write production code:** Implement the actual functionality
- **Run all tests:** Ensure all tests pass, including new and existing ones
- **Verify functionality:** Confirm the implementation meets requirements
- **Get user confirmation:** User must test the result and confirm it meets expectations
- **Refactor if needed:** Clean up code while maintaining test coverage (refactor phase)

### Step 5: Documentation and Status Updates

- **Update all documentation:** Follow documentation maintenance guidelines
- **Update task status:** Mark completed tasks in `/_meta/project-task-list.md`
- **Update test documentation:** Record test status in `/test/test-documentation.md`
- **Update CHANGELOG.md:** Document user-facing changes
- **Review code documentation:** Ensure JSDoc comments are current

### Step 6: Version Control

- **Commit changes:** Use conventional commit messages
- **Include all related files:** Ensure tests, documentation, and code are committed together
- **Write descriptive commit messages:** Explain what was implemented and why
- **Keep commits atomic:** Each commit should represent a complete, working feature

### Step 7: Workflow Completion Check

- **Mandatory workflow completion:** User must complete the entire workflow before moving to next task
- **Incremental development:** Remind users to finish current workflow before starting new tasks
- **Repository hygiene:** Ensure codebase, documentation, and repository remain up-to-date
- **Quality gates:** All tests must pass, documentation must be current, and code must be committed

## Workflow Enforcement Rules

### Before Starting Any New Task

```
STOP: Complete the current workflow first!

Before proceeding with a new task, ensure:
✅ Current task is documented and committed
✅ All tests are passing
✅ Documentation is updated
✅ User has confirmed the implementation meets expectations
✅ Changes are committed with proper messages

Only then proceed with the next task planning phase.
```

### Quality Gates

- **No shortcuts:** Every step must be completed in order
- **No parallel tasks:** Focus on one task at a time until fully complete
- **No skipping tests:** TDD approach is mandatory
- **No incomplete documentation:** All documentation must be current
- **No uncommitted changes:** All work must be committed before moving on

### Workflow Violations

If a user requests to skip steps or start new work before completing the workflow:

1. **Politely decline:** Explain the importance of completing the current workflow
2. **Remind of benefits:** Emphasize how this maintains code quality and project health
3. **Offer to complete current workflow:** Help finish the current task properly first
4. **Suggest task breakdown:** If the current task is too large, suggest breaking it down

## Benefits of This Workflow

- **Higher code quality:** TDD ensures robust, well-tested code
- **Better documentation:** Always current and comprehensive
- **Reduced technical debt:** Incremental approach prevents accumulation of shortcuts
- **Improved maintainability:** Clear task tracking and documentation
- **Team collaboration:** Consistent approach enables better teamwork
- **Risk mitigation:** Small, tested changes reduce deployment risks

## Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Synchronous operations that block the event loop
- Callback hell (use async/await instead)
- Missing error handling in async operations
- Hardcoded configuration values
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Memory leaks from unclosed connections
- Missing input validation and sanitization
- Exposing sensitive information in logs or responses

## Suggested Improvements

When providing code suggestions, prioritize:

1. **Security:** Address potential security vulnerabilities first
2. **Performance:** Optimize for scalability and response times
3. **Maintainability:** Make code easier to understand and modify
4. **Testing:** Ensure comprehensive test coverage
5. **Documentation:** Keep API documentation current
6. **Monitoring:** Add appropriate logging and metrics
