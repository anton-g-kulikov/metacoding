# Project Structure Guidelines

## Root Directory Standards

- **Clean Root:** Only essential files in root (README.md, CHANGELOG.md, package.json, LICENSE)
- **Configuration Files:** Keep configuration files organized and well-documented
- **Git Ignore:** Properly configured to exclude build artifacts, node_modules, temporary files, and IDE-specific files

## Directory Organization

```
/src                    # All source code
  /components          # Reusable components
  /services           # Business logic and services
  /types              # Type definitions
  /utils              # Utility functions
  /constants          # Application constants
/test                  # All test-related files
  /fixtures           # Test fixtures and sample data
  /unit               # Unit tests
  /integration        # Integration tests
/_meta                  # Development documentation
/.github              # GitHub-specific files (workflows, templates)
/.vscode              # VS Code workspace settings
```

## Documentation Structure

- **Meta Documentation:** All development docs in `/_meta` folder
  - `project-task-list.md` - Current tasks and roadmap
  - `system-documentation.md` - General system documentation
  - `architecture.md` - System architecture decisions
  - `api-design.md` - API design patterns and conventions
- **Test Documentation:** All test docs in `/test` folder
  - `test-documentation.md` - Testing framework, guidelines, and test case status
- **Root README.md:** Comprehensive project documentation including overview, setup, usage, and API reference

## Temporary File Management

- **Cleanup Policy:** All temporary files created during development or testing must be cleaned up after serving their purpose
- **No Orphaned Files:** Never leave temporary files, debug outputs, or experimental code in the repository
- **Appropriate Relocation:** Move useful temporary content to proper locations:
  - Test data → `/test/fixtures/`
  - Documentation samples → relevant documentation files
  - Configuration examples → `/examples/` or documentation
  - Debug outputs → Remove entirely or convert to proper logging

## File Naming and Organization

- **Source Files:** Never place source code directly in root folder
- **Test Files:** Keep all tests organized within `/test` folder structure
- **Feature Grouping:** Organize files by feature/domain, not by file type
- **Single Purpose:** One main export per file when possible

# Development Guidelines

## Core Development Practices

- **Language Standards:** Follow language-specific coding standards defined in language instruction files
- **Modular Design:** Follow separation of concerns and single responsibility principles
- **Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling with proper logging and user feedback
- **Resource Management:** Ensure proper cleanup of resources, event listeners, and disposables
- **Temporary File Hygiene:** Clean up all temporary files, debug outputs, and experimental code after development sessions
- **Performance:** Consider performance implications and optimization opportunities
- **Security:** Follow secure coding practices, validate inputs, and sanitize outputs

## Testing Strategy

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Write tests before implementing features when possible
- **Coverage Goals:** Aim for high test coverage of critical functionality
- **Test Types:**
  - Unit tests for individual functions and components
  - Integration tests for feature workflows
  - End-to-end tests for user scenarios
- **Test Data:** Use realistic fixtures and sample data for testing
- **Continuous Testing:** Run tests on every commit and before deployment

## Documentation Standards

- **Documentation Architecture:** Maintain strict separation between system documentation (evergreen, no status indicators) and project management documentation (status tracking, temporal language)
- **Code Documentation:** Use appropriate documentation standards for the project language (see language-specific instruction files)
- **README Updates:** Keep main README.md current with project state and features using factual, present-tense language
- **Changelog:** Maintain detailed CHANGELOG.md with all notable changes
- **API Documentation:** Document all public APIs with examples and usage patterns
- **Architecture Decisions:** Record significant architectural decisions in `/_meta` folder
- **Status Indicators:** Use status emojis only in project management docs, never in system documentation

## Version Control and Workflow

- **Commit Messages:** Use conventional commit format (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`)
- **Branch Strategy:** Use feature branches and meaningful branch names
- **Code Reviews:** All changes require review before merging
- **Release Management:** Follow semantic versioning (SemVer) principles

## Code Review Criteria

When reviewing code or generating suggestions, consider:

- **Functionality:** Does the code work as intended?
- **Readability:** Is the code easy to understand and maintain?
- **Performance:** Are there any performance concerns or improvements?
- **Security:** Are there any security vulnerabilities or best practices violated?
- **Testing:** Is the code adequately tested?
- **Documentation:** Is the code properly documented?
- **Standards Compliance:** Does the code follow project conventions?

## Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Deep nesting (prefer early returns and guard clauses)
- Long functions or classes (break into smaller, focused units)
- Magic numbers or strings (use named constants)
- Tight coupling between modules
- Inconsistent error handling patterns
- Missing or inadequate logging
- Hardcoded configuration values
- Blocking operations that could impact performance

## Suggested Improvements

When providing code suggestions, prioritize:

1. **Correctness:** Ensure the code works and handles edge cases
2. **Maintainability:** Make code easier to understand and modify
3. **Performance:** Optimize for speed and memory usage when relevant
4. **Security:** Address potential security vulnerabilities
5. **Testability:** Make code easier to test and debug
6. **Consistency:** Align with existing codebase patterns and conventions

# Development Workflow

## Mandatory Development Process

**ALL development tasks must follow this strict workflow to ensure code quality, proper testing, and comprehensive documentation.**

### Step 1: Task Understanding and Planning

- **Always start with clarification:** Ask questions to fully understand the requirements
- **Provide implementation outline:** Present the shortest possible outline of the implementation plan with key details
- **Get explicit confirmation:** Wait for user confirmation before proceeding
- **Clarify scope:** Ensure both parties understand what will be implemented and what won't
- **Document first, execute second:** No implementation work begins until all required documentation is complete
- **Mandatory confirmation gates:** User must explicitly approve the plan, scope, and consequences before any work begins

### Step 2: Task Management

- **Document before executing:** Add corresponding task(s) to `/_meta/project-task-list.md` BEFORE any implementation work
- **Set task status:** Mark tasks as "In Progress" with clear descriptions
- **Break down complex tasks:** Split large tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks
- **Estimate effort:** Provide realistic time/complexity estimates
- **Task documentation requirement:** Every task must be documented in the task list before work begins

### Step 3: Test-Driven Development (TDD)

- **Document test cases first:** Write test cases in `/test/test-documentation.md` BEFORE implementing any tests
- **Define expected behavior:** Clearly specify inputs, outputs, and edge cases in documentation
- **Only then implement tests:** Create actual test files after test cases are documented
- **Verify test failure:** Run tests to confirm they fail appropriately (red phase)
- **Then implement code:** Write the minimum code needed to make tests pass (green phase)
- **Clean up test artifacts:** Remove temporary test files, move useful test data to `/test/fixtures/`
- **Test documentation requirement:** All test cases must be documented before any test code is written

### Step 4: Implementation and Verification

- **Write production code:** Implement the actual functionality
- **Run all tests:** Ensure all tests pass, including new and existing ones
- **Verify functionality:** Confirm the implementation meets requirements
- **Get user confirmation:** User must test the result and confirm it meets expectations
- **Refactor if needed:** Clean up code while maintaining test coverage (refactor phase)
- **File cleanup:** Remove all temporary files, debug outputs, and experimental code created during development

### Step 5: Documentation and Status Updates

- **Update all documentation:** Follow documentation maintenance guidelines
- **Update task status:** Mark completed tasks in `/_meta/project-task-list.md`
- **Update test documentation:** Record test status in `/test/test-documentation.md`
- **Update CHANGELOG.md:** Document user-facing changes
- **Review code documentation:** Ensure code documentation is current

### Step 6: Version Control

- **Commit changes:** Use conventional commit messages
- **Include all related files:** Ensure tests, documentation, and code are committed together
- **Write descriptive commit messages:** Explain what was implemented and why
- **Keep commits atomic:** Each commit should represent a complete, working feature

### Step 7: Workflow Completion Check

- **Mandatory workflow completion:** User must complete the entire workflow before moving to next task
- **Incremental development:** Remind users to finish current workflow before starting new tasks
- **Repository hygiene:** Ensure codebase, documentation, and repository remain up-to-date
- **Quality gates:** All tests must pass, documentation must be current, and code must be committed

## Workflow Enforcement Rules

### Documentation-First Principle

**MANDATORY: Document first, execute second for ALL development work.**

- **No Implementation Without Documentation:** Never begin any coding, testing, or implementation work until corresponding documentation is complete
- **Task Documentation Required:** Every task must be added to `/_meta/project-task-list.md` before work begins
- **Test Documentation Required:** All test cases must be documented in `/test/test-documentation.md` before writing any test code
- **Confirmation Gates:** User must explicitly confirm understanding of plan, scope, and consequences before proceeding
- **Examples of Required Documentation-First Workflow:**
  - ✅ Correct: "I'll add this task to the task list, then document the test cases, then get your confirmation before implementing"
  - ❌ Incorrect: "I'll implement this feature and update the documentation afterwards"
  - ✅ Correct: "Let me document these test cases in test-documentation.md first, then implement the tests"
  - ❌ Incorrect: "I'll write the tests now and document them later"

### Single-Task Focus Enforcement

**MANDATORY: One change at a time - never mix tasks in one iteration.**

- **No Task Mixing:** Never work on two different tasks simultaneously or mix unrelated changes in one iteration
- **Scope Creep Management:** When additional requests arise during active work, use proper scope management:
  - **Option A (Blocking):** If the new request blocks current work, write it as a subtask in `/_meta/project-task-list.md` and address it within current workflow
  - **Option B (Non-blocking):** If the new request is unrelated, write it as a separate task and complete current workflow first
- **Task-Switching Prevention:** Politely but firmly redirect users who try to switch tasks mid-workflow
- **Enforcement Templates:**
  - ✅ Correct response: "I've added that request to the task list. Let me complete the current workflow first, then we can address it as a separate task."
  - ✅ Correct response: "That's a great idea! I'll add it as a subtask since it relates to our current work."
  - ❌ Incorrect: "Sure, let me switch to that new request right now."
- **Examples of Proper Scope Management:**
  - ✅ Good: "I notice you want to add authentication. I'll add that as a separate task and complete our current database setup first."
  - ❌ Bad: "Let me add authentication while we're working on the database setup."
  - ✅ Good: "I see this test failure requires fixing the validation logic. I'll add that as a subtask since it blocks our current work."

### Before Starting Any New Task

```
STOP: Complete the current workflow first!

Before proceeding with a new task, ensure:
✅ Current task is documented and committed
✅ All tests are passing
✅ Documentation is updated
✅ User has confirmed the implementation meets expectations
✅ Changes are committed with proper messages

Only then proceed with the next task planning phase.
```

### Quality Gates

- **No shortcuts:** Every step must be completed in order
- **No parallel tasks:** Focus on one task at a time until fully complete
- **No skipping tests:** TDD approach is mandatory
- **No incomplete documentation:** All documentation must be current
- **No uncommitted changes:** All work must be committed before moving on

### Workflow Violations

If a user requests to skip steps or start new work before completing the workflow:

1. **Politely decline:** Explain the importance of completing the current workflow
2. **Remind of benefits:** Emphasize how this maintains code quality and project health
3. **Offer to complete current workflow:** Help finish the current task properly first
4. **Suggest task breakdown:** If the current task is too large, suggest breaking it down

#### Handling Scope Creep and Task Switching

When users request additional work or try to switch tasks during active development:

**For New Related Work:**

- Add as subtask to current task if it blocks progress
- Example: "I'll add that validation fix as a subtask since it's needed for our current feature"

**For New Unrelated Work:**

- Add to task list as separate task
- Politely redirect to complete current work first
- Example: "Great idea! I've added that to the task list. Let me finish the current database setup first, then we can tackle the UI updates as a separate task."

**If User Insists on Task Switching:**

- Gently remind about "one change at a time" principle
- Explain benefits of focused work
- Example: "I understand the urgency, but following our 'one change at a time' principle ensures we don't leave incomplete work. Let me finish this current task properly, then we can give full attention to your new request."

**Template Responses for Common Scenarios:**

- "I've noted that request in the task list. Completing our current workflow first ensures quality."
- "That's related to our current work, so I'll add it as a subtask to address now."
- "I see that's a separate concern. Let me add it to our task list and complete this workflow first."

## Benefits of This Workflow

- **Higher code quality:** TDD ensures robust, well-tested code
- **Better documentation:** Always current and comprehensive
- **Reduced technical debt:** Incremental approach prevents accumulation of shortcuts
- **Improved maintainability:** Clear task tracking and documentation
- **Team collaboration:** Consistent approach enables better teamwork
- **Risk mitigation:** Small, tested changes reduce deployment risks
