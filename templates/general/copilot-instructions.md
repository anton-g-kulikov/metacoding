# Project Structure Guidelines

## Root Directory Standards

- **Clean Root:** Only essential files in root (README.md, CHANGELOG.md, package.json, LICENSE)
- **Configuration Files:** Keep configuration files organized and well-documented
- **Git Ignore:** Properly configured to exclude build artifacts, node_modules, temporary files, and IDE-specific files

## Directory Organization

```
/src                    # All source code
  /components          # Reusable components
  /services           # Business logic and services
  /types              # Type definitions
  /utils              # Utility functions
  /constants          # Application constants
/test                  # All test-related files
  /fixtures           # Test fixtures and sample data
  /unit               # Unit tests
  /integration        # Integration tests
/_meta                  # Development documentation
/.github              # GitHub-specific files (workflows, templates)
/.vscode              # VS Code workspace settings
```

## Documentation Structure

- **Meta Documentation:** All development docs in `/_meta` folder
  - `project-task-list.md` - Current tasks and roadmap
  - `system-documentation.md` - General system documentation
  - `architecture.md` - System architecture decisions
  - `api-design.md` - API design patterns and conventions
- **Test Documentation:** All test docs in `/test` folder
  - `test-documentation.md` - Testing framework, guidelines, and test case status
- **Root README.md:** Comprehensive project documentation including overview, setup, usage, and API reference

## Temporary File Management

- **Cleanup Policy:** All temporary files created during development or testing must be cleaned up after serving their purpose
- **No Orphaned Files:** Never leave temporary files, debug outputs, or experimental code in the repository
- **Appropriate Relocation:** Move useful temporary content to proper locations:
  - Test data → `/test/fixtures/`
  - Documentation samples → relevant documentation files
  - Configuration examples → `/examples/` or documentation
  - Debug outputs → Remove entirely or convert to proper logging

## File Naming and Organization

- **Source Files:** Never place source code directly in root folder
- **Test Files:** Keep all tests organized within `/test` folder structure
- **Feature Grouping:** Organize files by feature/domain, not by file type
- **Single Purpose:** One main export per file when possible

# Development Guidelines

## Core Development Practices

- **Language Standards:** Follow language-specific coding standards defined in language instruction files
- **Modular Design:** Follow separation of concerns and single responsibility principles
- **Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling with proper logging and user feedback
- **Resource Management:** Ensure proper cleanup of resources, event listeners, and disposables
- **Temporary File Hygiene:** Clean up all temporary files, debug outputs, and experimental code after development sessions
- **Performance:** Consider performance implications and optimization opportunities
- **Security:** Follow secure coding practices, validate inputs, and sanitize outputs

## Testing Strategy

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Write tests before implementing features when possible
- **Coverage Goals:** Aim for high test coverage of critical functionality
- **Test Types:**
  - Unit tests for individual functions and components
  - Integration tests for feature workflows
  - End-to-end tests for user scenarios
- **Test Data:** Use realistic fixtures and sample data for testing
- **Continuous Testing:** Run tests on every commit and before deployment

## Documentation Standards

- **Documentation Architecture:** Maintain strict separation between system documentation (evergreen, no status indicators) and project management documentation (status tracking, temporal language)
- **Code Documentation:** Use appropriate documentation standards for the project language (see language-specific instruction files)
- **README Updates:** Keep main README.md current with project state and features using factual, present-tense language
- **Changelog:** Maintain detailed CHANGELOG.md with all notable changes
- **API Documentation:** Document all public APIs with examples and usage patterns
- **Architecture Decisions:** Record significant architectural decisions in `/_meta` folder
- **Status Indicators:** Use status emojis only in project management docs, never in system documentation

## Version Control and Workflow

- **Commit Messages:** Use conventional commit format (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`)
- **Branch Strategy:** Use feature branches and meaningful branch names
- **Code Reviews:** All changes require review before merging
- **Release Management:** Follow semantic versioning (SemVer) principles

## Code Review Criteria

When reviewing code or generating suggestions, consider:

- **Functionality:** Does the code work as intended?
- **Readability:** Is the code easy to understand and maintain?
- **Performance:** Are there any performance concerns or improvements?
- **Security:** Are there any security vulnerabilities or best practices violated?
- **Testing:** Is the code adequately tested?
- **Documentation:** Is the code properly documented?
- **Standards Compliance:** Does the code follow project conventions?

## Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Deep nesting (prefer early returns and guard clauses)
- Long functions or classes (break into smaller, focused units)
- Magic numbers or strings (use named constants)
- Tight coupling between modules
- Inconsistent error handling patterns
- Missing or inadequate logging
- Hardcoded configuration values
- Blocking operations that could impact performance

## Suggested Improvements

When providing code suggestions, prioritize:

1. **Correctness:** Ensure the code works and handles edge cases
2. **Maintainability:** Make code easier to understand and modify
3. **Performance:** Optimize for speed and memory usage when relevant
4. **Security:** Address potential security vulnerabilities
5. **Testability:** Make code easier to test and debug
6. **Consistency:** Align with existing codebase patterns and conventions

# Development Workflow

## Mandatory Development Process

**ALL development tasks must follow this strict workflow to ensure code quality, proper testing, and comprehensive documentation.**

**General Instruction:**

- The agent must always proceed through all workflow steps in order, without stopping or waiting for reminders, unless explicit user confirmation is required by the workflow. After completing each step, immediately continue to the next, ensuring the workflow is fully completed for every task.

### Step 1: Task Understanding and Planning

- **Always start with clarification:**
  - Begin by thoroughly reading the project system documentation, reviewing the project folders and files structure, and examining the most important code sections.
  - Measure your own uncertainty level regarding the user's initial query or answers on a scale from 1 (total uncertainty) to 0.1 (very low uncertainty).
  - If your uncertainty is greater than 0.1, continue reading documentation and exploring the project and codebase before asking clarifying questions.
  - If, after 5 clarification attempts, your uncertainty remains above 0.1, explicitly state this and propose a research plan before proceeding.
- **Provide implementation outline:** Present the shortest possible outline of the implementation plan with key details
- **Get explicit confirmation:** Wait for user confirmation before proceeding
- **Clarify scope:** Ensure both parties understand what will be implemented and what won't
- **Document first, execute second:** No implementation work begins until all required documentation is complete
- **Mandatory confirmation gates:** User must explicitly approve the plan, scope, and consequences before any work begins

**After completing Step 1:**

- Immediately proceed to Step 2 (Task Management) once user confirmation is received and documentation is complete.

### Step 2: Task Management

- **Document before executing:** Add corresponding task(s) to `/_meta/project-task-list.md` BEFORE any implementation work
- **Use standardized task naming:** Follow the `[AREA]-TASK-[NUMBER]` format for all tasks
  - **Area Prefixes:** Use appropriate prefixes (CORE, API, UI, DB, AUTH, UTIL, CONFIG, DOC, CLI, TMPL, etc.)
  - **Examples:** `CLI-TASK-001: Implement validate command`, `DOC-TASK-002: Update API documentation`
- **Set task status:** Mark tasks as "In Progress" with clear descriptions and status indicators
- **Break down complex tasks:** Split large tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks with sequential numbering
- **Estimate effort:** Provide realistic time/complexity estimates
- **Task documentation requirement:** Every task must be documented in the task list before work begins

**After completing Step 2:**

- Immediately proceed to Step 3 (Test-Driven Development) and ensure all test cases are documented before writing any test code.

### Step 3: Test-Driven Development (TDD)

- **Document test cases first:** Write test cases in `/test/test-documentation.md` BEFORE implementing any tests
- **Define expected behavior:** Clearly specify inputs, outputs, and edge cases in documentation
- **Only then implement tests:** Create actual test files after test cases are documented
- **Verify test failure:** Run tests to confirm they fail appropriately (red phase)
- **Then implement code:** Write the minimum code needed to make tests pass (green phase)
- **Clean up test artifacts:** Remove temporary test files, move useful test data to `/test/fixtures/`
- **Test documentation requirement:** All test cases must be documented before any test code is written

**After completing Step 3:**

- Immediately proceed to Step 4 (Implementation and Verification) and implement the required functionality.

### Step 4: Implementation and Verification

- **Write production code:** Implement the actual functionality
- **Run all tests:** Ensure all tests pass, including new and existing ones
- **Verify functionality:** Confirm the implementation meets requirements
- **Get user confirmation:** User must test the result and confirm it meets expectations
- **Refactor if needed:** Clean up code while maintaining test coverage (refactor phase)
- **File cleanup:** Remove all temporary files, debug outputs, and experimental code created during development

**After completing Step 4:**

- Immediately proceed to Step 5 (Documentation and Status Updates) and update all relevant documentation and status indicators.

### Step 5: Documentation and Status Updates

- **Update all documentation:** Follow documentation maintenance guidelines
- **Update task status:** Mark completed tasks in `/_meta/project-task-list.md`
- **Update test documentation:** Record test status in `/test/test-documentation.md`
- **Update CHANGELOG.md:** Document user-facing changes
- **Review code documentation:** Ensure code documentation is current

**After completing Step 5:**

- Immediately proceed to Step 6 (Version Control) and commit all changes with proper messages.

### Step 6: Version Control

- **Commit changes:** Use conventional commit messages
- **Include all related files:** Ensure tests, documentation, and code are committed together
- **Write descriptive commit messages:** Explain what was implemented and why
- **Keep commits atomic:** Each commit should represent a complete, working feature

**After completing Step 6:**

- Immediately proceed to Step 7 (Workflow Completion Check) and verify that all workflow requirements are satisfied.

### Step 7: Workflow Completion Check

- **Mandatory workflow completion:** User must complete the entire workflow before moving to next task
- **Incremental development:** Remind users to finish current workflow before starting new tasks
- **Repository hygiene:** Ensure codebase, documentation, and repository remain up-to-date
- **Quality gates:** All tests must pass, documentation must be current, and code must be committed

**After completing Step 7:**

- Confirm that the workflow is fully complete and only then allow planning or starting a new task. Never stop at an intermediate step unless user confirmation is explicitly required by the workflow.

# Repeated Tasks and Checklist Templates

For any recurring, high-risk, or multi-step process (such as npm package release, GitHub release, major version update, or similar workflows), always use a dedicated checklist template to ensure all necessary steps are followed and nothing is missed.

- **Checklist Template Principle:**
  - Maintain a template checklist file for each repeated process (e.g., `npm-publish-checklist.md`).
  - For each new instance (e.g., each release or version), copy the template checklist and tag it with the relevant version or context, preserving the original template for future use.
  - Systematically work through the checklist for every instance of the repeated task, marking each step as completed.
  - Proactively identify any process that would benefit from a checklist and prompt the user to use or create one if it does not exist.
  - If, during execution, you or the user identify missing or unclear steps, update the template checklist to improve future reliability.

**Examples of repeated tasks requiring checklists:**

- npm package publishing
- GitHub release process
- Major/minor version updates
- Production deployment
- Onboarding new contributors
- Any other process with multiple required steps or risk of omission

**Agent Guidance:**

- Always check for the existence of a checklist template before starting a repeated task.
- If a template does not exist, prompt the user to create one and assist in drafting it.
- When using a checklist, copy it for the specific instance (e.g., `npm-v1.5.0.md`), and work through each step systematically.
- If new steps are discovered or improvements are needed, update the template and inform the user.
