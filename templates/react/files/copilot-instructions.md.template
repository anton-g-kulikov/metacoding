# React-Specific Coding Standards

## Component Development

- **Function Components:** Always use function components with hooks
- **TypeScript:** Strong typing for all props, state, and event handlers
- **Component Naming:** PascalCase for components (e.g., `UserProfile`, `NavigationMenu`)
- **File Organization:** One component per file, matching component name
- **Props Interface:** Define explicit interfaces for all component props

## React Patterns and Best Practices

### Component Structure
```typescript
// Preferred component structure
interface ComponentProps {
  // Props interface first
}

const Component: React.FC<ComponentProps> = ({ prop1, prop2 }) => {
  // Hooks at the top
  const [state, setState] = useState();
  const { data } = useQuery();
  
  // Event handlers
  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
    // Handler logic
  }, [dependencies]);
  
  // Render
  return (
    <div>
      {/* JSX content */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default Component;
```

### Hook Usage Guidelines
- **useState:** Use for local component state
- **useEffect:** Handle side effects, cleanup properly
- **useCallback:** Memoize event handlers passed to child components
- **useMemo:** Memoize expensive calculations
- **useContext:** Access global state without prop drilling
- **Custom Hooks:** Extract reusable stateful logic

### State Management
- **Local State:** useState for component-specific state
- **Global State:** Context API for app-wide state, or external library (Redux, Zustand)
- **Server State:** React Query/SWR for data fetching and caching
- **Form State:** Controlled components or form libraries (React Hook Form)

## File and Directory Organization

└── styles/              # Global styles and themes
```

## Naming Conventions

- **Components:** PascalCase (e.g., `UserCard.tsx`, `SearchInput.tsx`)
- **Hooks:** camelCase with "use" prefix (e.g., `useUserData.ts`, `useLocalStorage.ts`)
- **Pages:** PascalCase (e.g., `HomePage.tsx`, `UserProfilePage.tsx`)
- **Utilities:** camelCase (e.g., `formatDate.ts`, `validateEmail.ts`)
- **Constants:** SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `API_ENDPOINTS.ts`, `THEME_COLORS.ts`)
- **Types:** PascalCase (e.g., `User.ts`, `ApiResponse.ts`)

# React Development Guidelines

## Development Workflow and File Management

### Temporary File Management
- **React Development Cleanup:** Remove all temporary JSX/TSX files, component experiments, and debug components after development sessions
- **Build Artifact Cleanup:** Clean up development build outputs, bundle analyzer reports, and performance profiling files
- **Component Playground:** Move useful component experiments to Storybook stories or proper example components
- **Mock Data Management:** Organize temporary API mock data into `/src/mocks/` or `/test/fixtures/` directories
- **Debug Component Removal:** Remove debug wrappers, console.log statements, and temporary styling before commits

## Component Design Principles

### Single Responsibility
- Each component should have one clear purpose
- Break down complex components into smaller, focused ones
- Use composition over inheritance

### Props Design
```typescript
// Good: Specific, typed props
interface ButtonProps {
  variant: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'danger';
  size: 'small' | 'medium' | 'large';
  onClick: () => void;
  disabled?: boolean;
  children: React.ReactNode;
}

// Avoid: Generic, untyped props
interface BadProps {
  [key: string]: any;
}
```

### Performance Optimization
- **React.memo:** Memoize components that receive stable props
- **useCallback/useMemo:** Prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Code Splitting:** Use React.lazy for route-level splitting
- **Bundle Analysis:** Monitor and optimize bundle size
- **Image Optimization:** Use appropriate formats and lazy loading

## Testing Strategy

### Testing Levels
- **Unit Tests:** Individual components and hooks (Jest + React Testing Library)
- **Integration Tests:** Component interactions and data flow
- **E2E Tests:** Critical user flows (Cypress/Playwright)

### Testing Best Practices
```typescript
// Example component test
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
import { Button } from './Button';

describe('Button', () => {
  test('calls onClick handler when clicked', () => {
    const handleClick = jest.fn();
    render(<Button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</Button>);
    
    fireEvent.click(screen.getByRole('button'));
    expect(handleClick).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
  });
});
```

### Test Organization
- **Component Tests:** Co-located with components (`Button.test.tsx`)
- **Hook Tests:** Test custom hooks in isolation
- **Integration Tests:** Test component combinations
- **Test Utilities:** Shared test helpers and mock data

## Accessibility (a11y) Standards

### ARIA and Semantic HTML
- Use semantic HTML elements (button, nav, main, etc.)
- Provide ARIA labels for interactive elements
- Ensure proper heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3, etc.)
- Include alt text for images

### Keyboard Navigation
- Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Implement proper focus management
- Use focus indicators for keyboard users

### Screen Reader Support
- Use descriptive text for links and buttons
- Provide context for form inputs
- Test with screen readers

## Error Handling and Logging

### Error Boundaries
```typescript
// Error boundary for component error handling
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { hasError: false };
  }

  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
    return { hasError: true };
  }

  componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo) {
    console.error('Component error:', error, errorInfo);
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      return <ErrorFallback />;
    }

    return this.props.children;
  }
}
```

### API Error Handling
- Implement proper error states in UI
- Show user-friendly error messages
- Provide retry mechanisms for failed requests
- Log errors for debugging

## Build and Development Tools

### Development Setup
- **Vite/Create React App:** Modern build tooling
- **ESLint:** Code linting with React-specific rules
- **Prettier:** Code formatting
- **TypeScript:** Static type checking
- **Husky:** Git hooks for code quality

### Recommended ESLint Rules
```json
{
  "extends": [
    "react-app",
    "react-app/jest",
    "@typescript-eslint/recommended"
  ],
  "rules": {
    "react-hooks/exhaustive-deps": "warn",
    "react/prop-types": "off",
    "@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars": "error"
  }
}
```

## State Management Patterns

### Context API Usage
```typescript
// User context example
const UserContext = createContext<UserContextType | undefined>(undefined);

export const UserProvider: React.FC<{ children: React.ReactNode }> = ({ children }) => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState<User | null>(null);
  
  const value = useMemo(() => ({
    user,
    setUser,
    logout: () => setUser(null)
  }), [user]);
  
  return (
    <UserContext.Provider value={value}>
      {children}
    </UserContext.Provider>
  );
};

export const useUser = () => {
  const context = useContext(UserContext);
  if (!context) {
    throw new Error('useUser must be used within UserProvider');
  }
  return context;
};
```

### Data Fetching Patterns
- Use React Query/SWR for server state management
- Implement loading and error states
- Handle caching and background updates
- Optimize for user experience

## Performance Best Practices

### Bundle Optimization
- Tree shaking for unused code elimination
- Code splitting at route and component level
- Lazy loading for non-critical components
- Optimize third-party library usage

### Runtime Performance
- Avoid inline object/function creation in render
- Use production builds for performance testing
- Monitor Core Web Vitals
- Implement proper memoization strategies

## Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### React-Specific Anti-Patterns
- **Mutating State Directly:** Always use setState/useState setter
- **Missing Dependencies:** Include all dependencies in useEffect
- **Overusing useEffect:** Prefer derived state when possible
- **Prop Drilling:** Use context or state management for deep nesting
- **Large Components:** Break down into smaller, focused components
- **Inline Styles:** Use CSS modules or styled-components for styling

### Component Design Anti-Patterns
- **God Components:** Components with too many responsibilities
- **Tight Coupling:** Components that depend on specific parent structure
- **Missing Error Handling:** Components that don't handle error states
- **Poor Accessibility:** Missing ARIA labels and semantic HTML

## Deployment and Production Considerations

### Build Optimization
- Enable production mode optimizations
- Configure proper caching headers
- Implement service workers for offline functionality
- Use CDN for static assets

### Monitoring and Analytics
- Implement error tracking (Sentry, Bugsnag)
- Monitor performance metrics
- Track user interactions and conversions
- Set up alerts for critical issues

## React Development Workflow

## Mandatory Development Process

**ALL React development tasks must follow this strict workflow to ensure component quality, proper testing, and comprehensive documentation.**

### Step 1: Task Understanding and Planning

- **Always start with clarification:** Ask questions to fully understand the React component/feature requirements
- **Provide implementation outline:** Present the shortest possible outline of the React implementation plan with component structure
- **Get explicit confirmation:** Wait for user confirmation before proceeding with React development
- **Clarify scope:** Ensure both parties understand what React components will be implemented and what won't

### Step 2: Task Management

- **Update task list:** Add corresponding task(s) to `/_meta/project-task-list.md`
- **Set task status:** Mark React development tasks as "In Progress" with clear descriptions
- **Break down complex components:** Split large React components into smaller, manageable subtasks
- **Estimate effort:** Provide realistic time/complexity estimates for React development

### Step 3: Test-Driven Development (TDD) for React

- **Document test cases first:** Write React test cases in `/test/test-documentation.md` with component scenarios
- **Define component behavior:** Clearly specify component props, state changes, and user interactions
- **Implement component tests:** Create React Testing Library tests that verify documented behavior
- **Verify test failure:** Run tests to confirm they fail appropriately (red phase)
- **Implement components:** Write the minimum React component code needed to make tests pass (green phase)
- **Clean up test artifacts:** Remove temporary test components, move useful test data to `/test/fixtures/`

### Step 4: Implementation and Verification

- **Write React components:** Implement actual component functionality with proper TypeScript typing
- **Run all tests:** Ensure all React tests pass, including unit and integration tests
- **Verify component functionality:** Test components in browser and confirm they meet requirements
- **Get user confirmation:** User must test the React components and confirm they meet expectations
- **Refactor components:** Clean up React code while maintaining test coverage and component structure
- **File cleanup:** Remove temporary React files, debug components, experimental JSX, and console.log statements

### Step 5: Documentation and Status Updates

- **Update all documentation:** Follow documentation maintenance guidelines for React projects
- **Update task status:** Mark completed React tasks in `/_meta/project-task-list.md`
- **Update test documentation:** Record React test status in `/test/test-documentation.md`
- **Update CHANGELOG.md:** Document user-facing React component changes
- **Review component documentation:** Ensure JSDoc comments and component docs are current

### Step 6: Version Control

- **Commit changes:** Use conventional commit messages for React changes (feat: add Button component)
- **Include all related files:** Ensure React tests, documentation, and components are committed together
- **Write descriptive commit messages:** Explain what React components were implemented and why
- **Keep commits atomic:** Each commit should represent a complete, working React feature

### Step 7: Workflow Completion Check

- **Mandatory workflow completion:** User must complete the entire React workflow before moving to next task
- **Incremental development:** Remind users to finish current React workflow before starting new components
- **Repository hygiene:** Ensure React codebase, documentation, and repository remain up-to-date
- **Quality gates:** All React tests must pass, documentation must be current, and code must be committed

## React Workflow Enforcement Rules

### Before Starting Any New React Task

```
STOP: Complete the current React workflow first!

Before proceeding with a new React component/feature, ensure:
✅ Current React task is documented and committed
✅ All React tests are passing
✅ Component documentation is updated
✅ User has confirmed the React implementation meets expectations
✅ React changes are committed with proper messages

Only then proceed with the next React task planning phase.
```

### React Quality Gates

- **No shortcuts:** Every React development step must be completed in order
- **No parallel components:** Focus on one React component at a time until fully complete
- **No skipping React tests:** TDD approach is mandatory for all React components
- **No incomplete documentation:** All React component documentation must be current
- **No uncommitted changes:** All React work must be committed before moving on

### React Workflow Violations

If a user requests to skip steps or start new React work before completing the workflow:

1. **Politely decline:** Explain the importance of completing the current React workflow
2. **Remind of benefits:** Emphasize how this maintains React code quality and component health
3. **Offer to complete current workflow:** Help finish the current React task properly first
4. **Suggest component breakdown:** If the current React component is too large, suggest breaking it down

## Benefits of This React Workflow

- **Higher React code quality:** TDD ensures robust, well-tested React components
- **Better component documentation:** Always current and comprehensive React documentation
- **Reduced technical debt:** Incremental React approach prevents accumulation of shortcuts
- **Improved maintainability:** Clear React task tracking and component documentation
- **Team collaboration:** Consistent React approach enables better teamwork
- **Risk mitigation:** Small, tested React changes reduce deployment risks

---

**Remember:** Focus on creating maintainable, accessible, and performant React applications that provide excellent user experience while following modern development practices.
