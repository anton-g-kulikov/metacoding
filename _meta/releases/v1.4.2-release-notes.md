# Release Notes: metacoding v1.4.2

**Release Date:** June 26, 2025  
**Package:** [metacoding@1.4.2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/metacoding)  
**GitHub Tag:** [v1.4.2](https://github.com/anton-g-kulikov/metacoding/releases/tag/v1.4.2)

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Cursor Workflow Rules Generation

Fixed critical issue with Cursor workflow.mdc file generation that was causing duplicate and redundant content.

**What was fixed:**

- **Single Source Logic**: workflow.mdc now mirrors only the general copilot-instructions.md template instead of merging all instruction files
- **Deduplication**: Eliminated duplicate content that was causing the workflow.mdc file to be unnecessarily large
- **Clean Output**: Reduced workflow.mdc file size and complexity while maintaining all essential workflow guidance
- **Pattern-Specific Rules**: Preserved existing logic for generating pattern-specific .mdc files (e.g., typescript.mdc, python.mdc)

**Impact:**

- Cleaner, more focused Cursor workflow files
- Reduced file size and improved performance
- Better user experience with less redundant guidance
- Maintained full functionality while improving efficiency
