- [x] **LANG-TASK-001: Create JavaScript-specific instruction template** - ✅ **COMPLETED** - Created complete JavaScript template with instruction files covering ES6+ modern patterns, Node.js runtime considerations, npm ecosystem best practices, JavaScript testing frameworks guidance, browser compatibility and build tool considerations, and comprehensive template.json configuration with proper CLI integration and project detector support.

## 5. IDE Integration

- [x] **IDE-TASK-001: IDE Integration Foundation** - ✅ **COMPLETED** - Implemented VS Code settings automatic configuration, Git repository detection and setup, and project type detection logic.

- [x] **CURSOR-TASK-001: Implement Cursor IDE support for AI-assisted development** - ✅ **COMPLETED** - Implemented complete Cursor IDE support with architecture documentation, core CursorService implementation, CLI integration with AI setup choice, file generation logic for workflow.cursorrules and pattern-specific .cursor/rules/\*.mdc files, comprehensive integration and end-to-end tests (19/19 tests passing), and updated documentation with Cursor IDE setup options and usage examples.

- [x] **TMPL-TASK-001: Ensure JavaScript template is fully compatible with both CLI and Cursor IDE** - ✅ **COMPLETED** - Successfully implemented complete JavaScript template with proper instruction files, fixed template manager to include JavaScript case handling, ensured universal .gitignore patterns, and validated all functionality with comprehensive test coverage (12/12 tests passing, 228/228 project tests passing).

- [x] **CUR-TASK-001: Update Cursor rules file structure to match modern Cursor IDE requirements** - ✅ **COMPLETED** - Researched current Cursor IDE rules file requirements, updated implementation to write general workflow rules to .cursor/rules/workflow.mdc, validated MDC format with frontmatter, fixed failing Cursor-related tests, and updated backup/migration test logic to handle both legacy and modern file paths.

## 6. Architecture & Standards

- [x] **ARCH-TASK-001: Abstract Instruction Files for Single Source of Truth** - ✅ **COMPLETED** - Successfully implemented composable instruction file architecture to abstract language-specific coding requirements from copilot-instructions and other instruction files to separate, composable files, creating single universal instruction files that reference language-specific instruction files, eliminating duplication and enabling easier maintenance.
