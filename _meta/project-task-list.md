- [x] **Implement table format and improved naming conventions for test documentation** - Converted test-documentation.md to use clean table format with structured Test Case IDs following [AREA]-[TYPE]-[NUMBER] pattern
- [x] **Update instruction files with standardized test documentation format** - Updated all test-runner.instructions.md and docs-update.instructions.md files across main and template directories with table format requirements and naming conventions
- [x] **Generalize instruction templates for reusability** - Updated area prefixes from metacoding-specific to language-appropriate and generic conventions
- [x] **Create language-specific area prefixes for test naming** - Implemented React/Frontend (COMP, HOOK, PAGE, STORE), Node.js/Backend (API, SRV, DB, MW, ROUTE), Python/Django (VIEW, MODEL, FORM, CMD), and General (CORE, API, UI, DB) prefixes
- [x] **Update examples in instruction files to match new conventions** - Replaced all metacoding-specific examples with language-appropriate test case examples
