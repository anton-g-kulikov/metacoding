## 🔧 Instruction File Architecture Abstraction

### Abstract Instruction Files for Single Source of Truth ✅

- **Priority**: High (architectural improvement, reduces maintenance burden)

### Publishing and Distribution

- [ ] **Prepare for npm publishing (build scripts, files field)**
- [ ] **Create GitHub release workflow**
- [ ] **Set up semantic versioning**
- [ ] **Publish initial version to npm**
- [ ] **Update project documentation with npm instructions**

- **Scope**: Update test descriptions in all test files while keeping file names unchanged
- **Areas to cover**: FILESYSTEM, CLI, TEMPLATE, INIT, VALIDATE, UPDATE
- **Status**: Complete
- **Priority**: High (required for npm publishing readiness)
- **Files updated**:
  - [x] `test/unit/filesystem.test.ts` - CORE-UNIT-001 through CORE-UNIT-010
