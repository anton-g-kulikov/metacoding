## üéØ What is `metacoding`?

`metacoding` is a **guided development methodology** that uses GitHub Copilot's custom instruction capabilities to help developers at any level follow established best practices. Instead of just getting code suggestions, you get:

- **Structured workflows** that guide you through proven development practices
- **Quality standards** that help you avoid common mistakes
- **Test-driven development** that's encouraged and guided step-by-step
- **Documentation guidance** that keeps your projects maintainable

## üí¨ How to Use `metacoding` with GitHub Copilot

`metacoding` transforms GitHub Copilot into an autonomous development partner that executes structured workflows. You specify what you want built, and Copilot independently follows a disciplined 7-step process that ensures quality, maintainability, and thorough testing. Your role is to provide clear requirements, validate results, and approve each stage before proceeding.

### The `metacoding` 7-Step Development Workflow

Every development task follows this mandatory workflow to ensure quality and consistency:

#### Step 1: Describe Your Feature or Task

Be specific about what you want to build. Copilot will automatically follow the workflow and create a comprehensive plan for your approval.

- **Be specific about requirements**: Clearly describe the feature, functionality, or problem to solve
- **Provide context**: Include relevant constraints, user needs, or business requirements
- **Review Copilot's plan**: Copilot will automatically create an implementation outline following workflow standards
- **Approve or refine**: Confirm the plan meets your needs or request adjustments
- **Example prompt**: _"I want to add user authentication to my web app. Users should be able to register with email/password, login securely, logout, and have password reset functionality. The system should handle validation errors gracefully."_

#### Step 2: Verify Task Documentation

Copilot will automatically document tasks following the workflow. Your role is to review and approve the breakdown.

- **Review task breakdown**: Copilot will add tasks to your project list and create subtasks
- **Verify scope boundaries**: Ensure what's included and excluded is clear and appropriate
- **Approve documentation**: Confirm the task structure before Copilot proceeds to testing
- **Example verification**: _"Review the authentication tasks you've added. Does this scope make sense for our current iteration?"_

#### Step 3: Validate Test Strategy

Copilot will automatically document test cases before implementation. You verify the testing approach meets your quality standards.

- **Review test documentation**: Copilot will document all test scenarios following TDD principles
- **Verify coverage**: Ensure happy paths, error scenarios, and edge cases are included
- **Approve test approach**: Confirm the testing strategy before Copilot implements failing tests
- **Example verification**: _"Check the test cases you've documented for authentication. Are we covering all the important scenarios?"_

#### Step 4: Monitor Implementation Progress

Copilot will implement functionality to make tests pass. You track progress and validate the working solution.

- **Track implementation**: Copilot will write minimal code following TDD red-green-refactor cycle
- **Verify test results**: Copilot will run tests and report results - you confirm they're passing
- **Test functionality yourself**: Validate that the implementation works as expected in practice
- **Example check**: _"Show me the test results and let me verify the authentication is working correctly."_

#### Step 5: Review Documentation Updates

Copilot will automatically update all documentation. You verify completeness and accuracy of updates.

- **Review documentation changes**: Copilot will update README, API docs, and code comments
- **Verify task status updates**: Confirm completed work is properly marked in project management docs
- **Approve changelog entries**: Review user-facing changes recorded in changelog
- **Example review**: _"Show me what documentation you've updated for the authentication feature. Let me verify it's accurate and complete."_

#### Step 6: Approve Version Control

Copilot will create proper commits following conventional standards. You approve the commit structure and messages.

- **Review commit structure**: Copilot will prepare atomic commits with conventional messages
- **Verify file inclusion**: Ensure all related files (code, tests, docs) are included together
- **Approve commits**: Confirm the commit represents complete, working functionality
- **Example approval**: _"Show me the commit you've prepared for the authentication feature. Does it include everything we've built?"_

#### Step 7: Confirm Workflow Completion

Copilot will verify workflow completion automatically. You perform final validation before moving to new work.

- **Review completion checklist**: Copilot will verify all tests pass, documentation is updated, and changes are committed
- **Confirm clean repository state**: Verify temporary files are cleaned up and repository is organized
- **Approve workflow completion**: Give explicit approval before starting any new tasks
- **Example confirmation**: _"Confirm our authentication workflow is complete and we're ready for the next feature."_

### Workflow Enforcement and Quality Assurance

`metacoding` enforces strict quality practices:

- **Documentation-First Principle**: No coding begins until documentation is complete
- **Single-Task Focus**: One change at a time - never mix unrelated tasks
- **Confirmation Gates**: User approval required before proceeding with implementation
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive testing mandatory for all functionality
- **Repository Hygiene**: Clean up temporary files and maintain organization

### Effective Workflow Prompts

**Starting a new feature:**
_"Let's implement feature X following the 7-step workflow. First, help me understand requirements and create an implementation plan."_

**During development:**
_"We're on step 3 of our workflow. Document the test cases for this component before implementing tests."_

**Scope management:**
_"I want to add feature Y, but we're working on feature X. Add Y to the task list and let's complete X first."_

**Quality check:**
_"Review our current workflow step. Are we ready to proceed, or do we need to complete documentation first?"_

### Automatic Context Application

GitHub Copilot automatically applies relevant instruction files based on your work:

- **Test files** ‚Üí Applies test-driven development and quality standards
- **Documentation** ‚Üí Enforces documentation architecture and maintenance guidelines
- **Code files** ‚Üí Provides code review criteria and quality standards
- **Release files** ‚Üí Guides version management and release procedures

### Manual Instruction Reference

For specific guidance, explicitly reference instruction files:

- _"Use the 7-step workflow to implement user registration"_
- _"Apply code review guidelines to check this function"_
- _"Follow test documentation standards to update our test cases"_
- _"Use release instructions to prepare version 2.1.0"_

### Workflow Violations and Corrections

If you try to skip steps or mix tasks, Copilot will redirect you:

- **Skipping documentation**: _"Let's document this task first before implementing"_
- **Task switching**: _"I've added that to the task list. Let's complete our current workflow first"_
- **Missing tests**: _"We need to document and implement tests before the production code"_

### Best Practices for Workflow Success

1. **Start small**: Begin with simple features to practice the workflow
2. **Stay focused**: Complete one task fully before starting another
3. **Trust the process**: The workflow prevents technical debt and quality issues
4. **Attach context**: Include task lists, documentation, and related files in prompts
5. **Confirm understanding**: Always confirm plans before implementation begins

The `metacoding` workflow transforms chaotic development into a structured, quality-driven process that scales from personal projects to enterprise teams.
