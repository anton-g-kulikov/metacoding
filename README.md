## üéØ What is `metacoding`?

`metacoding` is a **guided development methodology** that uses AI assistant custom instruction capabilities to help developers at any level follow established best practices. Works seamlessly with GitHub Copilot in VS Code and Cursor IDE. Instead of just getting code suggestions, you get:

- **Structured workflows** that guide you through proven development practices
- **Quality standards** that help you avoid common mistakes
- **Test-driven development** that's encouraged and guided step-by-step
- **Documentation guidance** that keeps your projects maintainable

## üí¨ How to Use `metacoding` with AI Assistants

`metacoding` transforms AI assistants (GitHub Copilot or Cursor IDE) into autonomous development partners that execute structured workflows. You specify what you want built, and your AI assistant independently follows a disciplined 7-step process that ensures quality, maintainability, and thorough testing. Your role is to provide clear requirements, validate results, and approve each stage before proceeding.

### The `metacoding` 7-Step Development Workflow

Every development task follows this mandatory workflow to ensure quality and consistency:

#### Step 1: Describe Your Feature or Task

Be specific about what you want to build. Copilot will automatically follow the workflow and create a comprehensive plan for your approval.

- **Be specific about requirements**: Clearly describe the feature, functionality, or problem to solve
- **Provide context**: Include relevant constraints, user needs, or business requirements
- **Review Copilot's plan**: Copilot will automatically create an implementation outline following workflow standards
- **Approve or refine**: Confirm the plan meets your needs or request adjustments
- **Example prompt**: _"I want to add user authentication to my web app. Users should be able to register with email/password, login securely, logout, and have password reset functionality. The system should handle validation errors gracefully."_

#### Step 2: Verify Task Documentation

Copilot will automatically document tasks following the workflow. Your role is to review and approve the breakdown.

- **Review task breakdown**: Copilot will add tasks to your project list and create subtasks
- **Verify scope boundaries**: Ensure what's included and excluded is clear and appropriate
- **Approve documentation**: Confirm the task structure before Copilot proceeds to testing
- **Example verification**: _"Review the authentication tasks you've added. Does this scope make sense for our current iteration?"_

#### Step 3: Validate Test Strategy

Copilot will automatically document test cases before implementation. You verify the testing approach meets your quality standards.

- **Review test documentation**: Copilot will document all test scenarios following TDD principles
- **Verify coverage**: Ensure happy paths, error scenarios, and edge cases are included
- **Approve test approach**: Confirm the testing strategy before Copilot implements failing tests
- **Example verification**: _"Check the test cases you've documented for authentication. Are we covering all the important scenarios?"_

#### Step 4: Monitor Implementation Progress

Copilot will implement functionality to make tests pass. You track progress and validate the working solution.

- **Track implementation**: Copilot will write minimal code following TDD red-green-refactor cycle
- **Verify test results**: Copilot will run tests and report results - you confirm they're passing
- **Test functionality yourself**: Validate that the implementation works as expected in practice
- **Example check**: _"Show me the test results and let me verify the authentication is working correctly."_

#### Step 5: Review Documentation Updates

Copilot will automatically update all documentation. You verify completeness and accuracy of updates.

- **Review documentation changes**: Copilot will update README, API docs, and code comments
- **Verify task status updates**: Confirm completed work is properly marked in project management docs
- **Approve changelog entries**: Review user-facing changes recorded in changelog
- **Example review**: _"Show me what documentation you've updated for the authentication feature. Let me verify it's accurate and complete."_

#### Step 6: Approve Version Control

Copilot will create proper commits following conventional standards. You approve the commit structure and messages.

- **Review commit structure**: Copilot will prepare atomic commits with conventional messages
- **Verify file inclusion**: Ensure all related files (code, tests, docs) are included together
- **Approve commits**: Confirm the commit represents complete, working functionality
- **Example approval**: _"Show me the commit you've prepared for the authentication feature. Does it include everything we've built?"_

#### Step 7: Confirm Workflow Completion

Copilot will verify workflow completion automatically. You perform final validation before moving to new work.

- **Review completion checklist**: Copilot will verify all tests pass, documentation is updated, and changes are committed
- **Confirm clean repository state**: Verify temporary files are cleaned up and repository is organized
- **Approve workflow completion**: Give explicit approval before starting any new tasks
- **Example confirmation**: _"Confirm our authentication workflow is complete and we're ready for the next feature."_

### Workflow Enforcement and Quality Assurance

`metacoding` enforces strict quality practices:

- **Documentation-First Principle**: No coding begins until documentation is complete
- **Single-Task Focus**: One change at a time - never mix unrelated tasks
- **Confirmation Gates**: User approval required before proceeding with implementation
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive testing mandatory for all functionality
- **Repository Hygiene**: Clean up temporary files and maintain organization

### Effective Workflow Prompts

**Starting a new feature:**
_"Let's implement feature X following the 7-step workflow. First, help me understand requirements and create an implementation plan."_

**During development:**
_"We're on step 3 of our workflow. Document the test cases for this component before implementing tests."_

**Scope management:**
_"I want to add feature Y, but we're working on feature X. Add Y to the task list and let's complete X first."_

**Quality check:**
_"Review our current workflow step. Are we ready to proceed, or do we need to complete documentation first?"_

### Automatic Context Application

GitHub Copilot automatically applies relevant instruction files based on your work:

- **Test files** ‚Üí Applies test-driven development and quality standards
- **Documentation** ‚Üí Enforces documentation architecture and maintenance guidelines
- **Code files** ‚Üí Provides code review criteria and quality standards
- **Release files** ‚Üí Guides version management and release procedures

### Manual Instruction Reference

For specific guidance, explicitly reference instruction files:

- _"Use the 7-step workflow to implement user registration"_
- _"Apply code review guidelines to check this function"_
- _"Follow test documentation standards to update our test cases"_
- _"Use release instructions to prepare version 2.1.0"_

### Workflow Violations and Corrections

If you try to skip steps or mix tasks, Copilot will redirect you:

- **Skipping documentation**: _"Let's document this task first before implementing"_
- **Task switching**: _"I've added that to the task list. Let's complete our current workflow first"_
- **Missing tests**: _"We need to document and implement tests before the production code"_

### Best Practices for Workflow Success

1. **Start small**: Begin with simple features to practice the workflow
2. **Stay focused**: Complete one task fully before starting another
3. **Trust the process**: The workflow prevents technical debt and quality issues
4. **Attach context**: Include task lists, documentation, and related files in prompts
5. **Confirm understanding**: Always confirm plans before implementation begins

The `metacoding` workflow transforms chaotic development into a structured, quality-driven process that scales from personal projects to enterprise teams.
