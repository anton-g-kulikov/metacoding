# Coding Standards and Conventions

## Language and Framework Preferences
- **Primary Language:** TypeScript for all code files
- **Code Style:** Follow project's ESLint/Prettier configuration
- **Target Compatibility:** [Specify target versions, e.g., "Node.js 18+, VS Code 1.74+"]

## Code Quality Guidelines
- **Readability:** Write self-explanatory code with meaningful names
- **Functions:** Keep functions focused and under 50 lines when possible
- **Magic Numbers:** Use named constants or enums instead of magic numbers
- **Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling with proper logging
- **Memory Management:** Ensure proper resource cleanup and disposal
- **Async Patterns:** Use async/await for I/O operations, avoid blocking operations

## Naming Conventions
- **Files:** Use kebab-case for file names (e.g., `user-service.ts`)
- **Classes:** PascalCase (e.g., `UserService`, `IUserRepository`)
- **Functions/Methods:** camelCase (e.g., `getUserById`, `validateInput`)
- **Variables:** camelCase (e.g., `userId`, `isValid`)
- **Constants:** SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS`)
- **Interfaces:** PascalCase with 'I' prefix (e.g., `IUserRepository`)
- **Types:** PascalCase (e.g., `UserData`, `ConfigOptions`)

## Code Organization
- **Single Responsibility:** One class/interface per file
- **Imports:** Group and order imports (external libraries, internal modules, relative imports)
- **File Structure:** Organize files by feature or layer, not by file type
- **Barrel Exports:** Use index.ts files for clean module exports

# Project Structure Guidelines

## Root Directory Standards
- **Clean Root:** Only essential files in root (README.md, CHANGELOG.md, package.json, LICENSE)
- **Configuration Files:** Keep configuration files organized and well-documented
- **Git Ignore:** Properly configured to exclude build artifacts, node_modules, temporary files, and IDE-specific files

## Directory Organization
```
/src                    # All source code
  /components          # Reusable components
  /services           # Business logic and services
  /types              # TypeScript type definitions
  /utils              # Utility functions
  /constants          # Application constants
/test                  # All test-related files
  /fixtures           # Test fixtures and sample data
  /unit               # Unit tests (*.test.ts)
  /integration        # Integration tests
/meta                  # Development documentation
/.github              # GitHub-specific files (workflows, templates)
/.vscode              # VS Code workspace settings
```

## Documentation Structure
- **Meta Documentation:** All development docs in `/meta` folder
  - `project-task-list.md` - Current tasks and roadmap
  - `project-documentation.md` - General project documentation
  - `architecture.md` - System architecture decisions
  - `api-design.md` - API design patterns and conventions
- **Test Documentation:** All test docs in `/test` folder
  - `test-documentation.md` - Testing framework, guidelines, and test case status
- **Root README.md:** Comprehensive project documentation including overview, setup, usage, and API reference

## File Naming and Organization
- **Source Files:** Never place source code directly in root folder
- **Test Files:** Keep all tests organized within `/test` folder structure
- **Feature Grouping:** Organize files by feature/domain, not by file type
- **Single Purpose:** One main export per file when possible

# Development Guidelines

## Core Development Practices
- **TypeScript First:** Use TypeScript for all code files with strict type checking
- **Modular Design:** Follow separation of concerns and single responsibility principles
- **Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling with proper logging and user feedback
- **Resource Management:** Ensure proper cleanup of resources, event listeners, and disposables
- **Performance:** Consider performance implications, especially for VS Code extensions (startup time, memory usage)
- **Security:** Follow secure coding practices, validate inputs, and sanitize outputs

## Testing Strategy
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Write tests before implementing features when possible
- **Coverage Goals:** Aim for high test coverage of critical functionality
- **Test Types:**
  - Unit tests for individual functions and components
  - Integration tests for feature workflows
  - End-to-end tests for user scenarios
- **Test Data:** Use realistic fixtures and sample data for testing
- **Continuous Testing:** Run tests on every commit and before deployment

## Documentation Standards
- **Code Documentation:** Use JSDoc comments for public APIs and complex logic
- **README Updates:** Keep main README.md current with project state and features
- **Changelog:** Maintain detailed CHANGELOG.md with all notable changes
- **API Documentation:** Document all public APIs with examples and usage patterns
- **Architecture Decisions:** Record significant architectural decisions in `/meta` folder

## Version Control and Workflow
- **Commit Messages:** Use conventional commit format (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`)
- **Branch Strategy:** Use feature branches and meaningful branch names
- **Code Reviews:** All changes require review before merging
- **Release Management:** Follow semantic versioning (SemVer) principles

## GitHub Release and Version Management
- **Version Bumping:** Update version in package.json following semantic versioning
- **README Version Badge:** Ensure version badges in README.md reflect current package.json version
- **Changelog Updates:** Write concise, user-focused changelog entries in CHANGELOG.md
  - Group changes by type: Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security
  - Include breaking changes prominently
  - Keep entries brief but descriptive (1-2 lines per change)
  - Reference issue/PR numbers when applicable
- **Release Process:**
  1. Update version in package.json
  2. Update README.md badges and version references
  3. Add entry to CHANGELOG.md with release date
  4. Commit with message: `chore: bump version to vX.Y.Z`
  5. Create GitHub release with tag matching package.json version
  6. Release notes should summarize key changes from CHANGELOG.md

## Code Review Criteria
When reviewing code or generating suggestions, consider:
- **Functionality:** Does the code work as intended?
- **Readability:** Is the code easy to understand and maintain?
- **Performance:** Are there any performance concerns or improvements?
- **Security:** Are there any security vulnerabilities or best practices violated?
- **Testing:** Is the code adequately tested?
- **Documentation:** Is the code properly documented?
- **Standards Compliance:** Does the code follow project conventions?

## Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- Deep nesting (prefer early returns and guard clauses)
- Long functions or classes (break into smaller, focused units)
- Magic numbers or strings (use named constants)
- Tight coupling between modules
- Inconsistent error handling patterns
- Missing or inadequate logging
- Hardcoded configuration values
- Synchronous operations that could block the main thread

## Suggested Improvements
When providing code suggestions, prioritize:
1. **Correctness:** Ensure the code works and handles edge cases
2. **Maintainability:** Make code easier to understand and modify
3. **Performance:** Optimize for speed and memory usage when relevant
4. **Security:** Address potential security vulnerabilities
5. **Testability:** Make code easier to test and debug
6. **Consistency:** Align with existing codebase patterns and conventions

# Task-Specific Instructions Files

## Using .instructions.md Files for Development Routines
Create specialized `.instructions.md` files in `.github/instructions/` for common development tasks:
